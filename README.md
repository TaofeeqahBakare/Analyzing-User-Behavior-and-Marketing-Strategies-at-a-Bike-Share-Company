# Analyzing-User-Behavior-and-Marketing-Strategies-at-a-Bike-Share-Company
Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. 

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

The business task is to analyze Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends and better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members and provide high-level recommendations for how these trends can help guide marketing strategy for the company with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
